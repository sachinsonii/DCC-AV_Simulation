# DCC-AV_Simulation
This project implements a simulation of autonomous vehicles using decentralized consensus and control strategies. The simulation is based on concepts presented in the conference paper:  "Decentralized Consensus and Control for Autonomous Vehicles" Presented at WPMC 24 IEEE at Sharda University.
